# warning

Code has no comments. Use at own risk. I need to get round to adding them.

The Gui folder is for using with a tkinter GUI, likely to be ignored for a while due to deciding to use a remote control
and streaming the camera(still to be implemented).

The Self-driving-controlled folder is for using with a remote control when controlling directly, and will eventually
stream the footage from the camera so that the user doesnt have to use a VNC. Will be capable of driving itself, but
currently this is nto implemented.
