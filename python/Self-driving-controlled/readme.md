# ReadMe
These python files are written to be object orientated (at times poorly), they need comments.
At the moment the tkinter stuff folder relies upon stuff in the folder, streamer.py relies upon
camera.py and the html in templates and controller_handler.py relies on ser.py. logger.py has
been written to be an all-purpose logger, although I havent implemented it anywhere yet.

# Dependencies
These files depend on the following python libraries:
- flask
- evdev
- logging
- serial
- tkinter
- sys
- imutils
- argparse
- time
- opencv

# Notice
These files are provide as-is, with no guarantee on if they will work or not, or even as intended.
